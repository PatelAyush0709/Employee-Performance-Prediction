##Introduction
Predicting employee performance is a crucial task for organizations to effectively manage their workforce. By identifying factors that contribute to high or low performance, organizations can optimize their strategies for employee development and engagement. This repository provides a solution for predicting employee performance using machine learning techniques.

##Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluating the model is  included in this repository . However, a sample dataset format and description are provided in the 'Data' directory. You can replace it with your own dataset for analysis and model training.

The dataset contains various attributes/features such as employee ID, Department, education level, Job Tenure, Performance , etc. These attributes will be used to train a predictive model that can estimate an employee's performance level.

##Model
The model used for predicting employee performance is a supervised machine learning model, specifically a classification algorithm.One classification algorithms can be used for this task, such as random forest. The choice of algorithm may depend on the specific requirements and characteristics of the dataset.

In addition to the chosen algorithm, the model development process may involve feature engineering, data preprocessing to improve prediction accuracy.

##Usage
To use this codebase and predict employee performance:


Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment:

code:
### --> cd model

### --> pip install -r requirements.txt


Replace the sample dataset in the 'Data' directory with your own dataset. Ensure that your dataset follows the same format as the sample dataset.


Run the main script to train the model and evaluate its performance:

code: 
###--> python main.py
Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new data by modifying the predict.py script.
